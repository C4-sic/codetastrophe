#summary CellFinder data logging

= File format =

If data saving is enabled in CellFinder, location data is stored on the SD card in the file `cellfinder.csv` in the root directory.

This CSV (comma separated value) file is formatted as such:

`Date, Network Operator, MCC, MNC, Cell LAC, Cell CID, Signal Strength, Location Provider, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Accuracy`

Data is appended to the file each time the location changes (either the GPS location or cell location). 

If you have your phone plugged into a computer and the SD card is mounted, the file can't be written to, so make sure you disconnect the phone from a PC before trying to use this feature.
